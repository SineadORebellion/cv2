    <h3>Bio</h3>
    I was born and raised in a suburb north of Chicago; close to where Home Alone and The
    Breakfast Club were filmed. After college, I spent a few years in Evanston, IL, working for a
    mortgage company. I purchased a vintage condo on the lake and renovated it. I turned the dining room
    into a 2nd bedroom and rented it out. After the crash of 2008, after my husband and I both lost
    our jobs, we moved to Albany Park to save money.
  </p>
  <p>
    Situated on the North side of Chicago, Albany Park is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the country.
    We thought we'd be here for a year as we regrouped, but after 10 years, we're still here!
    My husband works remotely for a big tech company. I work alongside him from our dining room that doubles
    as our home office. We have a clever daughter who is 10 and an energetic son who is 8. As our family has grown,
    we've created attractive, built-in storage solutions to meet our needs and make our space feel larger.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recently purchased a nearby bungalow. We're doing a <b>full</b> gut rehab! My husband has a background in
    construction engineering and I have a love of interior design and small space planning. We've
    torn <em>everything</em> out and changed the floorplan. I'm selecting all of the finishings from solid wood
    kitchen cabinets to a giant, fishing-basket, light fixture I plan to hang over the dining table. I can't
    wait to share photos of it all coming together!
