    <h3>Bio</h3>
    I was born and raised in a suburb north of Chicago. Close to where Home Alone and the
    Breakfast Club were filmed. For college, I attended Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.
    I sailed around the world while living and studying aboard a ship for a Semester at Sea Program.
    After college, I spent a few years in Evanston, IL. I got married, had a baby, and then after
    the crash of 2008; after my husband and I had lost our jobs and both of
    my parents' companies went out of business, we moved to Albany Park to save money.
  </p>
  <p>
    Situated on the North side of Chicago, Albany Park is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the country.
    We thought we'd be here for a year as we regrouped, but after 10 years, we're still here!
    My husband works remotely for a big tech company. I work along side him from our dining room that doubles
    as our home office. We have a clever daughter who is 10 (going on 30) and an energetic son who is 8.
  </p>
  <p>
    We purchased a nearby bungalow and we're doing a full gut rehab. It's exciting to make this
    little home our own! My husband has a background in construction engineering and I have a love of interior
    design and small space planning. We've edited the floorplan, and I'm selecting all of the finishings from solid wood
    kitchen cabinets to a fishing basket light fixture I purchased from Belgium.
